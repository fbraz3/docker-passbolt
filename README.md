# docker-passbolt

Official passbolt docker images are not built to run on ARM hardware, so I\`ve decided to build for my own

These images are a full-automated build from [oficial passbolt docker repository](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_docker), ready-to-go on ARM hardware.

Downloading the images  
`docker pull fbraz3/passbolt`
